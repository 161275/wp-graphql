This doesn't mean that the plugin isn't ready for use, it just means that there \nmight\n still be \nbugs\n and that there \nmight\n be breaking changes to the shape of the API or internal functions as we work toward a stable release. \n\n\nDon't hesitate to start using the plugin, but just be sure to follow along with \nreleases\n \nand keep up to date with conversations in \nSlack (join here)\n \n\n\nWPGraphQL is already in use in production on several sites, including \nwork.qz.com\n, \nhopelabs.org\n and more.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is WPGraphQL?\n\n\nWPGraphQL is A free, open-source WordPress plugin that provides an extendable \nGraphQL\n GraphQL Schema and API for any WordPress site.\n\n\nWPGraphQL provides a GraphQL API and \n/graphql\n endpoint for your WordPress site, allowing for interaction with WordPress data using \nGraphQL Queries and Mutations\n.\n\n\nWhat is GraphQL?\n\n\nGraphQL is an open source technical specification, developed and maintained by Facebook, for an application level query language. \n\n\nWhat does that mean? Basically GraphQL provides a consistent way to make declarative queries, which will enable you to more easily retrieve the data you want, and the shape that you want it in. \n\n\nGraphQL can be implemented in any language and can cover a vast amount of use cases. \n\n\nWPGraphQL exposes a WordPress installation's data through a GraphQL API. You can send a GraphQL request over HTTP to the \n/graphql\n endpoint provided by the plugin and in response you will get the matching JSON representation of your data.\n\n\n\n\nUse WPGraphQL without HTTP requests\n\n\nYou can also use GraphQL Queries and Mutations from within WordPress PHP without the need for HTTP network requests. \nLearn more\n\n\n\n\nWhy use WPGraphQL?\n\n\nWPGraphQL is arguably the easiest \nand\n most efficient way to interact with WordPress data.\n\n\nGraphQL enables small, efficient responses by only retrieving and returning exactly what was asked for, and nothing more.\n\n\nWPGraphQL helps reduce:\n\n\n\n\nHTTP Requests:\n Multiple resources can be fetched in a single request\n\n\nResponse size:\n Only the fields asked for are returned minimizing the payload downloaded by the client\n\n\nEndpoint Bloat:\n GraphQL provides a single endpoint and allows clients to ask for what they want from the single source. No need to memorize and maintain various feature endpoints.\n\n\nExternal Documentation:\n GraphQL is self-documenting, reducing the time and resources needed for maintaining API documentation\n\n\nTotal SQL queries:\n GraphQL queries can ask for multiple resources, or nested resources in a single request allowing GraphQL to determine the most efficient way to get the data from the database with as few SQL queries as possible.\n\n\nCode Duplication:\n Because GraphQL exposes all server capabilities in a single Schema, there's no need to duplicate code for various endpoints. The client can control the shape of their model without specific feature endpoint, which typically requires duplicate server code.\n\n\nOver/Under Fetching:\n With REST, you are constantly over and under-fetching at the same time. Endpoints typically have more data than you need, and not enough requiring round-trips to get other resources. GraphQL returns exactly what was asked for and can handle connections in a single request.\n\n\n\n\nWPGraphQL helps improve:\n\n\n\n\nPerformance:\n WPGraphQL utilizies existing WordPress Core APIs, such as WP_Query, so caching and filters are respected, but WPGraphQL also makes use of deferred resolvers and some look-ahead techniques (as all fields are known in the request before execution begins), allowing for data to be fetched and returned with as few SQL queries as possible. \n\n\nDeveloper Happiness:\n The strong-type system and explicit nature of GraphQL requests makes it easy for developers to understand GraphQL query and mutation requests long after code is written. Additionally, code duplication is drastically reduced as the API is defined in one spot, not in feature endpoints.\n\n\nVersioning:\n REST APIs and other APIs can be difficult to version. GraphQL makes \nevolving the API\n much easier than how other APIs are versioned. \n\n\nClient/Server Decoupling:\n Since the GraphQL server describes the capabilities and the client defines the shape of the model, the coupling between client and server is loosened. Clients can iterate their models without custom endpoints needing to be created or updated.\n\n\n\n\nHow does WPGraphQL Work?\n\n\nWPGraphQL adds a \n/graphql\n endpoint to your WordPress install. \n\n\nWhen HTTP requests are made to that endpoint, WPGraphQL executes the GraphQL request. \n\n\n\n\nUse WPGraphQL without HTTP requests\n\n\nYou can also use GraphQL Queries and Mutations from within WordPress PHP without the need for HTTP network requests. \nLearn more\n\n\n\n\nThe first part of the execution process, is validating the Query. Since GraphQL is centered around a strong typed Schema, before any real execution begins GraphQL can compare the request against the Schema to make sure the request is even valid. \n\n\nIf it's invalid, no execution occurs, errors are returned right away. \n\n\nIf the request is valid, GraphQL breaks down the fields and resolves them as a tree, passing the resolved data down to the next fields in the tree. \n\n\nTake this query for example: \n\n\n{\n  post(id:\n...\n) {\n     id\n     title\n     customField\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nBehind the Scenes, GraphQL uses native WordPress Core functions to resolve the post by it's ID. \n\n\n\\WP_Post::get_instance( $id );\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, GraphQL passes the Post down to the fields to be resolved.

            "text": "Exploring WPGraphQL\n\n\nIn this Tutorial, we will be exploring GraphQL using GraphiQL.\n\n\nGraphiQL\n\n\nGraphiQL\n is the de-facto tool for interacting with a GraphQL Schema. It's an open source graphical interactive in-browser GraphQL IDE. \n\n\nIt allows users to explore a GraphQL Schema's documentation, and execute GraphQL queries and mutations and see the response in real time.\n\n\nGraphiQL itself is a React component, so to use it, you need to either implement the React component, or use something that implements it already.\n\n\nGraphiQL Tools / Apps\n\n\nBelow is a (non-comprehensive) list of tools that implement GraphiQL that you can use to explore and experiment with your WPGraphQL API.\n\n\n\n\nGraphiQL Desktop App\n:\n GraphiQL as an Electron desktop app\n\n\nWPGraphiQL\n:\n WordPress plugin that adds GraphiQL to the WordPress admin dashboard \n\n\nGraphQL Playground\n:\n Desktop App from the folks at Graph.Cool.\n\n\nGraphQL IDE\n:\n Desktop App that supports multiple endpoint configurations\n\n\nAltair\n:\n Chrome Extension\n\n\nChromiQL\n:\n Chrome Extension\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Guide References the GraphiQL Desktop App\n\n\nThroughout this guide, for screenshots, etc we use \nGraphiQL Desktop App\n. Any specific info on using GraphiQL will be referring to that specific App, but should be generally applicable to any of them.\nFeel free to use the same one we use, explore the others, or even build your own!\n\n\n\n\nConfigure GraphiQL\n\n\nOnce you have a WordPress install setup with the \nWPGraphQL plugin installed and activated\n \nand the GraphiQL Desktop App (or other GraphiQL tool) \ninstalled\n, \nthe first thing you will want to do is point it at your WPGraphQL endpoint.\n\n\nWhen the app is first opened, you may notice a blank right pane, or an error showing that GraphiQL failed to fetch. \n\n\n\n\nThis is because GraphiQL isn't pointed to a valid GraphQL endpoint.\n\n\nPoint it at your endpoint\n\n\nToward the top of the App is a \"GraphQL Endpoint\" text field where you can paste in a URL to your WPGraphQL endpoint.\n\n\nI have a local WordPress install running at \nwpgraphql.dev\n, so my endpoint is \nhttp://wpgraphql.dev/graphql\n\n\nWhen I paste in my WPGraphQL url, the error goes away. This is because the App went and fetched my GraphQL schema and populated the GraphQL Documentation pane.\n\n\n\n\nExplore your Schema Docs\n\n\nAt this point, GraphiQL has fetched your WPGraphQL Schema and generated documentation that you can browse. \n\n\nAt the top left of GraphiQL, you should see a \"\n Docs\" link.\n\n\nClicking that expands the Documentation panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can adjust the width of the Documentation panel to your liking by selecting the left border of the panel and dragging and dropping.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Documentation panel, you can see that at the root of the WPGraphQL Schema is \nquery: RootQuery\n and \nmutation: RootMutation\n. \n\n\nThese are the root entry points to the WordPress Application Data Graph.\n\n\nYou can click into either to explore the capabilities nested below. \n\n\nFor example, clicking \nRooyQuery\n displays the fields that are available as part of the root. You can scroll through the list to see what's available. what the description is, what Type will be returned, and what arguments the field accepts.\n\n\n\n\nWhen looking at the GraphQL Docs, it might be overwhelming trying to understand what everything is that you're seeing. \n\n\nHere's an annotated breakdown of what is displayed in the Documentation panel as you explore the docs.\n\n\n\n\nSearch the Docs\n\n\nIn addition to clicking to explore the GraphQL Schema Docs, you can also search the documentation. Let's say you wanted to \nknow how to use GraphQL to query for pages. You could search \"page\" in the Search field in the Documentation pane, and \nyou would see all results in the Schema where \"page\" was mentioned. This can help understand all the entry points where \"pages\"\ncan be queried. \n\n\n\n\nWe can see here that there is a \"pages\" field on the RootQuery. Next, Let's try to query for pages!\n\n\nWrite Some Queries\n\n\nWe know we can query \"pages\" on the RootQuery, because we saw it in the docs, but how do we do that?\n\n\nWell, writing GraphQL Queries in GraphiQL is super intuitive. As you start typing, GraphiQL suggests fields that you might\nbe looking for and will complete them for you if you press Tab on the highlighted suggestion.\n\n\nLet's write a query to get a list of pages. \n\n\nGraphiQL has some helper text explaining how to write queries. We can select it all and remove it.\n\n\nThen, since \npages\n is a RootQuery field, we can simply start our query with an opening \n{\n bracket, then start typing \npage\n and we will see the autoselect pop-up.\n\n\nWe can arrow-down to select \npages\n, then press \ntab\n and it will autocomplete. \n\n\nThen we need to make a Selection on the \npages\n field. We can use the Documentation explorer to see what's available to query, or\nwe can just start typing to see what the Typeahead suggest tells us.\n\n\nOnce ready, click the Play button to execute the query.\n\n\nBelow, you can see using the Typeahead feature to help build a query and see what fields are available. You can also see how GraphiQL shows helpers \nwhen the syntax is broken by highlighting things red. \n\n\n\n\nQueries to try\n\n\nHere are some queries to try. Since GraphQL queries are static strings, you can simply copy these and paste them into your GraphiQL explorer.\n\n\nGet a List of Posts\n\n\n{\n  posts {\n    edges {\n      node {\n        id\n        title\n        date\n        content\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nGet a List of Posts with Author info\n\n\nThis is a pretty neat example of the power of GraphQL. Posts and Users are stored in different tables in WordPress and \ngetting Post Data and User data typically requires multiple queries. \n\n\nYou would typically first use \nWP_Query\n to get a list of posts, then while looping through the posts, you would get the author data by querying for that.\n\n\nGraphQL drastically simplifies that, allowing you to just declare what fields you want from each post, and what fields you want from each Post's author. And, \nbehind the scenes, WPGraphQL is doing some cool stuff to optimize the queries to make sure the fewest possible queries are run\nto get the needed data. \nLearn More\n\n\n{\n  posts {\n    edges {\n      node {\n        id\n        title\n        date\n        author {\n          id\n          name\n          username\n          description\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nGet a List of Users\n\n\n{\n  users {\n    edges {\n      node {\n        id\n        name\n        username\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nGet a List of Users with their Recent Posts\n\n\nWe saw earlier how we can query for Author data on posts, but we can also get to posts from the user as well.\n\n\nHere we are going to query for a list of users, then ask for each users posts, and for each post ask for the author. \n\n\nThat makes my head spin, but it's really not \nthat\n uncommon of a need.\n\n\nTry executing this and see what you get. \n\n\n{\n  users {\n    edges {\n      node {\n        id\n        name\n        username\n        posts {\n          edges {\n            node {\n              id\n              title\n              date\n              author {\n                id\n                name\n                username\n                description\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should see a list of users, and on each user you should see a list of posts, if that user has any, or empty post.edges if they don't. Then the posts should have an author field with the same author data as the user node.\n\n\nPretty neat!\n\n\nExploring Aliases\n\n\nGraphQL has a subtle but very powerful feature called Aliasing. You can set aliases on fields as you query, and the fields will\nbe returned to you using the specified Alias. \n\n\nThis really puts a lot of power in the clients hands.\n\n\nLets try a simple query with Aliases.\n\n\n{\n  recentPosts: posts {\n    items: edges {\n      post: node {\n        globalId: id\n        id: postId\n        articleTitle: title\n        articleDate: date\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nNow run that query and see how the fields are returned with the Aliases set as the key in the response. Wow!\n\n\nExploring Variables\n\n\nVariables are a very powerful feature of GraphQL.  \n\n\n\n\nComing Soon\n\n\nUntil we have time to write more info on this, you can learn more \nhere\n\n\n\n\nKeep Exploring\n\n\nAt this point, you should be familiar enough with GraphiQL to continue exploring what kind of data you can access.\n\n\nDebugging Requests\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nThis section applies particularly to the \nGraphiQL Desktop App\n as it's an Electron app.\n\n\n\n\nSince the GraphiQL Desktop App is an Electron App, it's built on Chromium, which means we can open up Chrome developer tools \nCommand + Option + I\n\n\nThen in Developer tools, navigate to the \nNetwork\n tab.\n\n\nWith the \nNetwork\n tab open, execute a GraphQL Query.\n\n\nYou can see the requests that are sent and the payloads that are returned. You can explore the headers and the formatting that GraphiQL uses to send requests, etc.\n\n\nUsing the Network tab can be helpful for debugging when something goes wrong and no response is rendered in the GraphiQL response pane.\n\n\n\n\nMore info coming soon\n\n\nThis section needs more info...",

We have tutorials written up on how to do this!\n\n\nLearn more about using Custom Post Types \n Taxonomies with WPGraphQL\n\n\nHow to override a field's resolver?\n\n\nSometimes you need granular control over how a specific field resolves. Field resolvers can easily be filtered so that you can control what is returned.\n\n\nLearn more about overriding Field resolvers\n\n\nWhat are \"edges\" and \"nodes\"?\n\n\nGraphQL itself makes no mandates on the shape of a Schema. This is great, but can also be problematic as a poorly defined schema can be difficult to use, extend, and version.\n\n\nThe shape of the WPGraphQL Schema is inspired heavily by the \nRelay spec\n.\n\n\nThe Relay spec introduces the concept of \nConnections\n. \n\n\nLet's compare what a naiive schema and a schema with Relay connections looks like.\n\n\nNaive Schema\n\n\n{\n  posts {\n    id\n    title\n    date\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nConnection Schema\n\n\n{\n  posts {\n    edges {\n      node {\n        id\n        title\n        date\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nedges\n serve as a place for where \"edge\" data can be exposed. The most common example is pagination cursors. \n\n\nPagination\n\n\nIn the \nnaiive schema\n, we just get a list of posts back. There's no data exposed that references where each\npost belongs in the larger data set. For pagination to work well, we need to be able to pass data back in our next query\nto indicate what posts we want to query next. \n\n\nThe cursor for a connection can be queried like so:\n\n\n{\n  posts {\n    pageInfo {\n      hasNextPage\n      hasPreviousPage\n      startCursor\n      endCursor\n    }\n    edges {\n      cursor\n      node {\n        id\n        title\n        date\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we ask for \npageInfo\n on the connection itself, where we ask for the \nstartCursor\n and \nendCursor\n. Additionally we ask for a cursor\nfor each \"node\" in the connection. \n\n\nThe cursor can be used as a reference to where in the overall data-set we are, and can be used to tell WPGraphQL where to start\nthe next query.\n\n\nFor example, if we queried for 10 items, and wanted to paginate through asking for the next 10 items, we could do so by first asking for 10 posts:\n\n\n{\n   posts( first: 10 ) {\n       pageInfo {\n         hasNextPage\n         hasPreviousPage\n         startCursor\n         endCursor\n       }\n       edges {\n         cursor\n         node {\n           id\n           title\n           date\n         }\n       }\n   }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, we would store the \nendCursor\n as a variable \n$endCursor = query.posts.pageInfo.endCursor\n and use that to tell WPGraphQL where to start the next query, like so:\n\n\n{\n   posts( first: 10, after: $endCursor ) {\n       pageInfo {\n         hasNextPage\n         hasPreviousPage\n         startCursor\n         endCursor\n       }\n       edges {\n         cursor\n         node {\n           id\n           title\n           date\n         }\n       }\n   }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nWPGraphQL takes the \nafter\n argument on the connection, and uses that to determine where to start the query and get the 10 posts after that point in the data set.\n\n\n\n\nVariables with GraphQL\n\n\nThis is a basic example showing variables in GraphQL Query. As you work with GraphQL more, there are better ways to handle variables in your GraphQL requests. \nLearn more about using GraphQL variables\n\n\n\n\nOther Edge Data\n\n\nPagination is an important part of the \"connection\" shape of the Schema, but \"edges\" provide a great spot for other info\nthat's not a property of either \"node\" in a connection. \n\n\nOne hypothetical example of edge data, would be a \nfriendsSince\n field on a connection between 2 friends in a Schema. A field like that isn't\na property of either user, it's a property that exists only in the context of the connection. A naiive schema wouldn't have a good way\nto display this \"edge\" data, but the Relay connection spec provides the nested edges/node shape to make it easy to query for \"edge\" data when needed.\n\n\n\n\nFood for thought\n\n\nPossibly WordPress will one day have a formal way to store Term_Relationship_Meta or Object_Relationship_Meta, where data can be stored when info about specific connections is needed. This would be perfect for displaying as \"edge\" data in the GraphQL Schema.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a GraphQL Client?\n\n\nA GraphQL client is anything that makes requests to a GraphQL server. Anything that can make an HTTP POST request (CURL, Postman, basically any programming language) can be a GraphQL client.\n\n\nIt's most common to use GraphQL in the context of JavaScript single page apps or native iOS and Android apps, and in that case, our recommendation is to use \nApollo Client\n. \n\n\nApollo Client is a caching GraphQL client that eases managing GraphQL requests and caches and normalized the responses a GraphQL server provides. Apollo client is community driven and is used by industry leaders including The New York Times, Qz.com, Intuit, IBM, KLM and more.\n\n\nWhy is the HTTP status 403?\n\n\nUnlike REST, where each endpoint represents a single resource, GraphQL allows for multiple resources to be fetched at once. Some data might be public, and some might not be. Some might resolve fine, and some might have errors.\n\n\nBecause of this, WPGraphQL will resolve as much of the data as it can and return it, and will return errors associated with the data it couldn't resolve.\n\n\nThe 403 status is default to indicate that the request is not authenticated. It doesn't mean there is anything wrong. WPGraphQL will still resolve the data that\ndoesn't require any type of authentication (which in many cases is all the data that was requested). \n\n\nHowever, for requests for private data or Mutations where authentication is required, it becomes more important to be able to identify when the server properly identifies authentication and when it doesn't.\n\n\nBy returning a 403 status for non-authenticated requests and a 200 status for authenticated requests, clients (such as Apollo) can use the status to ask users to re-authenticate as needed, for example when an Auth token has expired or a Password was changed, or any other reason authentication might fail on subsequent requests.\n\n\nHow many houses are in Iowa?\n\n\nNot sure why this is frequently asked, or if it even is, but you won't find the answer here...\n\n\nWhat if I have a new question?\n\n\nIf you have a question that isn't answered in the FAQ or in any of Tutorials or Reference guide, feel free to create an issue in Github, but be as specific and detailed as possible to give us the best chance to help you. \n\n\nAdditionally, you can reach out to the greater WPGraphQL community on Slack: \njoin here",
